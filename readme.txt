== Description ==

Karis is a clean and modern WordPress theme with an elegant, carefully crafted design.
This powerful, responsive blog theme is ideal for your personal or magazine-style blog,
whether your passion is travel, beauty, nature, photography, architecture, DIY... the list goes on!
Karis will make your WordPress look beautiful everywhere. The theme was designed with
the "mobile first" design, meaning it was designed for mobile from the beginning and
was adapted for bigger screen afterward. This result in a beautiful experience for
the users, on all devices. Unlimited accent colors, 2 featured area layouts, 13 different blog
listing layouts, dozens of configurable options - and all of this you
can manage with one click of your mouse in user friendly WordPress Customizer or when adding
new post or page.
